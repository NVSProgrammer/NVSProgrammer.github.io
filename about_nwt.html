        <summary>Name History of NWT Project</summary>
        NWT is the final name for the project.<br>
        The initial name was WebOS, as the primary goal was to have an easily controllable server workspace resembling an operating system that could work with other NVSProgrammer Projects. 
        However, the name WebOS was already taken by LG.<br> 
        NVSProgrammer struggled to find an alternative name other than "New Technology," which was also taken by Microsoft.<br>
        To differentiate, NVSProgrammer added an extra "W" (Way), resulting in "New Way Technology."<br>
        After NWT became the final name, NVSProgrammer began to group several projects together, and the main goal evolved to make working with technology easier and with more freedom.
